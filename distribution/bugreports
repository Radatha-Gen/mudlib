Since we are not superhumans, you will now and then encounter bugs in the code
(slight understatement).
When you have found a bug we would be very happy if you send us a bug report,
so we can include a corretion in our next release of the mudlib.

This is how you report bugs:

- The best thing is if you send us a description of the problem and
a bug fix in the form of a context diff.

- The second best thing is if you send us a description of the problem and
code to correct it, with a description of where to put it.

- A description of the problem and a hint about how to correct it is also fine.

- If you can't analyze the bug yourself, send us a description of the problem
and an exact description of how to repeat the phenomenon.

- Don't send bug reports of the type 'Sometimes you can carry an unlimited
ammount of weight'. These reports are of virtually no value to us, since we
are not about to go on wild goosecases after bugs that we haven't seen
with our own eyes.

- You should always mention what version of gamedriver and mudlib you are
using, and if you have made local modifications that may affect the problem,
you should say so too.

- Be patient. We are not working full time on the mud, and when we spend
time on it, we may have more urgent things to do than taking care of bug
reports. Under normal circumstances you will get a letter acknowleging
your report, but even that may take a bit of time.

- All reports should be mailed to mud@cd.chalmers.se

- It is also possible to contact us via Genesis, the LPmud running at CD.
There you can mail 'aom' to contact the mudlib-arch and his team or 'aog'
to contact the gamedriver arch' and his team.
