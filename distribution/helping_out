This is the first release of the CDLIB mudlib. There are still a lot of
things that have to be done. Some of the tasks can be carried out
independently, and we are happy if you want to help us getting them done.
You can do a number of them when you learn how the mudlib works internally.

- Submitted material should be sent to mud@cd.chalmers.se

- Use context diffs as far as possible to submit material.

- Send one email for each file treated.

- These are the things you can help us with; there isn't much glory in it,
but we would really appreciate the help:

All functions in the mudlib should have a proper comment header. Most of them
do, but quite a few still lack them. Take a file, add comments, make a
diff relative to the original, and submit the diff.

There are still a few corners of the mudlib that lack full typing. Add
typing and submit a diff.

Write tutorials for new wizards. There are lots of things that are new
or changed in LPMud 3.0, and many things that are special in CDLIB.
Examples of subjects that need treatment: How to use ed. What are mappings,
how do they work and when should I use them. Using arrays. (You can take
Groo's 2.4.5 tutorial and revise it.) Using the tracer commands.
The security system, what I need to know to make my objects work.
Making simple rooms and objects, what has to be in them and why.
Using heartbeat and call_out, an introduction. Types and what they mean.
A beginners guide to the mudlib files, how are they connected.

Write more and better examples.

Documneting different aspects of the gamedriver. For example: How
call_out is implemented. Important data structures and their use,
Executing a command, steps involved. How the call_other mechanism
works. How a program is compiled and loaded. The stack machine, an
instruction list and function description.
