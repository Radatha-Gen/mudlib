Syntax     : (object *)FIND_NEIGHBOURS(search, depth)
             (object *)FIND_NEIGHBOURS_SELF(search, depth)

Description: This will recursively search through the neighbouring rooms to a
             particular room or rooms to find the rooms where e.g. a shout or
             scream will be heard in.

             By default, FIND_NEIGHBOURS will EXCLUDE the room(s) that you use
             as seed. When using the FIND_NEIGHBOURS_SELF alternative, it will
             INCLUDE the seed room (for depths > 1)

Arguments  : object *search - the room or rooms still to search, start with
                              the core room(s). This may be a single room or an
                              an array of rooms.
             int    depth   - the depth still to search, minimum 1.

Returns    : object * - the neighbouring rooms.

Example    : FIND_NEIGHBOURS(core_room, 1)
             FIND_NEIGHBOURS_SELF( ({ core_room }), 2)
