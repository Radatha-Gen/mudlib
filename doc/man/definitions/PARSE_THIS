/*
 * PARSE_THIS(s, p)
 *
 * This define gives access to the function parse_this in the basic soul
 * COMMAND_DRIVER so that you do not have to copy it everywhere.
 *
 * s - the string to parse
 * p - the pattern to parse with
 *
 * For more information see "sman parse_this" for the description of
 * the function itself.
 *
 * An alternative would be to include <files.h> and then do:
 *
 *     oblist = (object *)COMMAND_DRIVER->parse_this(s, p [, ...]);
