Definition : NAME_TO_RANDOM(name, seed, range)

             based on the (lower case) name of a player. This way, for instance
             for quests or other hints, each combination of name, seed and range
             will result in the same number and you can use it to generat
             individual hints for individual players.

Arguments  : string name  - the lower case name of the player
             int    seed  - a large, unique number. You should select a
                            number of 7 or 8 digits for each different
                            situation you use the macro for.
             int    range - the range of the number [ 0 .. (range - 1) ]
