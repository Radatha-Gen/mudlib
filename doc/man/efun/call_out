NAME
        call_out - delayed execution of a function

SYNOPSIS
        int call_out(string func, int delay|float delay, void|mixed arg)

******* This efun exists for compatibility reasons. Use set_alarm for *********
******* new code.                                                     *********

DESCRIPTION
        With this function you can delay the call of a name function
        `func' for `delay' seconds. If `arg' is specified it is passed as 
	an argument to the function. If `arg' is not specified the id of 
	the callout will be passed as an argument to the function.
        The function returns the id of the callout.

NOTA BENE
        Neither "this_interactive()" nor "this_player()" is defined
        in a function that has been called by "call_out()". If you
        have a `write()' statement in the function that is called 
        with `call_out()' the output will end up in the game log.

WARNING
        Never, ever, make a repeating call_out inside a repeating
        call_out.  The call_out's generated will be exponential, and
        in less than a minute the entire mud will grind to a halt.
