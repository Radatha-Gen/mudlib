FTP   File Transfer Protocol
============================

FTP is a standard protocol for the transfer of files between computers
that are connected by a network. Rather than using the ed-editor to
create/edit files, you might want to have your files locally to examine
them, create new files or edit existing ones. For this purpose, FTP will
be available on most LPmud's.

To use FTP, you need to have a so-called FTP-client. These types of
programs are available for most types of operating systems, though can be
very basic in some cases. Other FTP-clients can be more extensive and
offer you more. The operation can be very different for command-driven or
windows-driven clients. This guide will therefore only deal with some of
the basic commands and concepts.

To begin a session, you have to start you client. Most clients accept
the site you want to connect to as commandline parameter. Otherwise, or
if you are already in the client, you can <open> a new connection. The
connection should be opened to the same site as you use to enter the
game, without the port-number! Your login name is '<wizname>' and you
can use your LPmud password to gain access.

When you are connected and logged in, your path will be set to your
home directory (example: /w/commander) if you are a wizard. Through FTP,
you have the same read and write rights as you have as a wizard in the game.

EXAMPLE
=======

Note to use port 1822 for FTP; to connect to the LPmud host:

        ftp mud.genesismud.org 1822

Your wizard user name and password are to be used for ftp too. You should not
use 'lpmud:' as was the case in the past. When you get access, you can use the
commands described above to download or upload files.


FILE TRANSFERS
==============

If you are using an operation system with a default line ending of 
CRLF (such as Windows) you need to perform code file transfers using ASCII
mode. This can often be toggled in your client if it does not do the correct
thing automatically.

Attempting to load files with incorrect line endings will show the error:
  'Illegal character (hex 0d) '' line 1'
 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
=================================

If you want to get a copy of the complete mudlib, rather than FTPing the
files from the LPmud host, you may FTP it in one archived file, a
so-called TAR-file. To get it, connect via FTP to ftp.cd.chalmers.se and
somewhere in the /public directory, you will find the mudlib with all
documentation that goes with it. The gamedriver can also be obtained from
that same site.

The same thing applies to acquiring a copy of all code in your domain or
a large portion of that code, for instance a complete area. Rather than
FTP-ing this bulk of files yourself, you might politely ask a member of
the administration with access to the local host to make a TAR for you to
FTP and unpack locally. This will only be done in special occasions and
requires the approval of your domain Liege! This file most certainly does
not mean that you have a right to such a TAR, but it only suggests the
possibility since it is totally up to the (kindness of) administration of
your LPmud game to provide such facility.
