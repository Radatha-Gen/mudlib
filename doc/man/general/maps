Creating Maps for the Magic Map
=================================

1. Intro

This document describes the map system for use with the magic map. A map
covers one or more rooms and can contain ascii art in addition to the layout
of the rooms. Each room is connected to only a single map. However, a map file
may contain a main map and one or more sub-maps. Or, perhaps more accurately,
a map file may contain multiple (detailed) maps and an overview that is zoomed
out from the detailed area(s).

2. Syntax

The map file may contain multiple maps, separated with by a line ::NEWMAP::
Each map itself consists of exactly three parts, separated by ::MAPDATA::
- a single line containing the name of the map
- multiple lines for the room files and their coordinates
  the coordinates may be followed by a designation of the submap.
- the map itself.

The coordinates are in the form X Y where the orgin (0,0) is the TOP LEFT
of the map. In the below example, that means that cave_A is 6 to the right
and then 4 down from the top left. In the below example, "O" is the (0,0)
top left origin.
