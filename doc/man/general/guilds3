Skills
======

The selection of skills available in a guild naturally depends on the type
(occupational, layman, or race) and the style (fighter, magic, cleric,
thief, ranger) of the guild. The style of the guild has to be clearly
defined and must be limited to one profession. So for example a 
fighter-cleric guild will not be accepted. (But one could for example 
create a guild which is an occupational fighter guild and a layman cleric
guild, occupying two guild slots instead of one, where it is impossible to
join only one branch.)

A minor guild should not offer any skills at all. They are simply not
intended to provide anything more than a bit of feeling in the game. 

As for the major guilds, the limits should be set like this:

- Occupational guilds:

The maximum amount of skills such a guild can offer is 550 taxable slots. 
In other words, only skill levels which exceed the maximum listed in 
'man skills' are counted towards this maximum.  All non-taxable skills
fall under the restrictions of the adventurer guild maximum.

The maximum teaching level in mudlib defined skills is 90.  Higher levels
can only be taught after a difficult quest has been completed.

- Layman guilds:

The maximum amount of skills a layman guild can offer is limited to 350
taxable slots.  In other words, only skill levels which exceed the 
maximum listed in 'man skills' are counted towards this maximum.  All 
non-taxable skills fall under the restrictions of the adventurer guild
maximum.

The maximum teaching level for mudlib defined skills is 60 for thoose 
skills cost multipliers are 1.0 or less.  Skills that have a multiplier 
(such as SS_WEP_SWORD) over the 1.0 multiplier can not be trained above 
the 50 level. 

- Race guilds:

The selection of skills should reflect the advantages of the race (a gnome
guild would probably offer trading), while excluding skills that the race
would never bother with (no hobbit guild should train swimming).

Guild specific skills may not give aid in combat. The guild may not train
specialized fighting skills as defined in /sys/ss_types.h.

The maximum amount of skills a racial guild can offer is limited to 150
taxable slots.  In other words, only skill levels which exceed the 
maximum listed in 'man skills' are counted towards this maximum.  All 
non-taxable skills fall under the restrictions of the adventurer guild
maximum.

The maximum teaching level for mudlib defined skills is 50, with the 
exception of general skills, they can be trained to 60, _only_ if the alien 
skill penality is applied to them.  So a guild offering 60 SS_SWIM would 
use up ((60 - 30) * 2) 60 taxable skill slots.

- General:

Each guild can define guild specific skills if appropriate. So a dwarf race
guild might teach 'minecraft', and a fighter guild will probably train a
special kind of attack or defence. However, think carefully in advance
before defining a skill that maybe never will be used. Remember to choose
skills defined by the mudlib (see /sys/ss_types.h), select from those
according to type and style of your guild. 

Guild specific skills may be trained to a maximum level of 100. They are
not counted towards the maximum skill levels for the guild. 

Skills which are alien to the guild style should be offered only in a very
limited way. So for example a thief guild might offer defence or parry
up to level 30, or a fighter guild could offer two magic skills up to
level 20. Skills alien to the guild style count twice towards the sum of
levels which the guild may offer _above_ the limits in 'man skills' (you do
not apply this penalty to the taxation of the skills which are alien). 

The Ranger style has no defined skills for that class, it is supposed to be 
a jack of all trades style, offering a wide varity of skills at realatively 
lower levels.  To reflect this they will pay a four times multiplier on all 
non general skills which exceed a certain level.  Occupational ranger styles 
have this limit impossed at the 75 skill level and the layman ranger have 
this limit impossed on them at the 50 skill level.  So if a occupational 
ranger guild offers 90 levels of SS_WEP_SWORD they would have to give up 
((75 - 30) + (15 * 4)) 105 taxable skill slots. A layman ranger guild 
offering 60 levels of SS_SNEAK would have to use ((50 - 20) + (10 * 4)) 70 
taxable skill slots.

Guild Stats
===========

Each type of guild is given a stat in the player. As all stats it is
governed by how much experience the player gains. Each time the player
gains experience %tax of it will end up in the guilds stat. 

For normal stats, players can set the %pref values. For the guild stat this
% value is the guild tax. This also means that if a player has joined a
guild, then he can not set his learn prefs to more than 100 - %tax. 

Only the normal stats are used to decide if it is time for a mortal to
become a wizard. The average should be 100. The guild stats are not
included in this, so the xp that goes to the guilds are in a sense lost to
the mortal. 

It is up to the guild to supply an interpretation of the guild stat. Some
might choose not to do this and that is quite ok. The main purpose is to
tax the players for joining a guild. It is of course more entertaining if
the guild stat actually means something. 

If a player joins or leaves a guild, the guild stat can be reset to 1
(Use clear_guild_stat()).

If you want one or more variables in the player measuring some prestige or
other advancement in the guild, this is easily solved using the skills
mechanism. Skills are in effect extra identifiable variables stored in the
player. You do not of course have to display the value as a skill.


Guild Council
=============

A guild can have leaders or a guild council. If the leaders of the guild
or the members of the guild council with the authority of their office can
exert power over fellow mortal members of the guild, the selection of the
leaders or the council members has to be done by mortals.

If the mortal leaders or council members have powers over their fellow 
guild members, players who want to join the guild must be told before they
join what these powers are.

The guildmaster sets up the rules, decides which powers the council
should have, and how the members are selected, but he or she may not
interfere in the selection process itself, nor may he or she meddle when
the council is using its privileges.

An example might look like this:
The guildmaster codes a system for the members of the guild to elect a 
council. The council can for example remove mortals from the guild or
make it impossible for a guild member to use the training facilites the
guild offers. 

The council then sets up the rules which the guild members have to
follow and decides on punishments.

If, for example, the council decides to make it illegal to kill certain
npcs, the guildmaster can either automatically remove a player from the
guild when he or she kills one of those npcs, or he can decide to leave
punitive measures to the council.

In this latter case, it is then solely up to the council members do
gather the information necessary to make a decision, and to enforce this
decision using the powers that have been bestowed upon them by the guild
master. If the council eg is not able to remove a player from the guild
without wizard intervention, because it lacks the necessary commands,
the player cannot be removed from the guild. 

The powers of the guild leaders or the council must remain within
reasonable limits, and should relate only to their guild. So it would be
illegal to make it possible for a guild council to reduce the quest exp
of a player, or to give the council access to log files, whereas it
would be legal to allow the council to remove a player from the guild
(with all the normal consequences of leaving the guild) or to make
WANTED posters, naming killers of npcs in a city, which the council
members can read like every other player.

Please keep in mind that the council members are mortals, so they should
not have wizard like powers or knowledge, but be subject to the risks of
second hand information and hearsay, lack of proofs and so on like any
other law enforcement officer.
