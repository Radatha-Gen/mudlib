For true beginners, some essential command-line basics need to be understood
before wizard work can get started ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Directory Structures & Navigational Commands:

        Files in Genesis are organized in directories which will need to
        be navigated via parser-style commands. Consider the following:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE:
When I type: cd /d/Genesis/doc/examples

I see the following:

CWD: /d/Genesis/doc/examples

EXPLANATION:
   ... I just navigated to a given file directory. <cd> was the command
       to do so. CWD: stands for Current Working Directory.

EXAMPLE:
When I type: ls

I see the following:

FILES              guild/             new/               spells/
READ_ME            guild_library/     obj/               tasks/
area_handler/      journal/           poison/            trade/
armours/           library/           room/              weapons/
door/              mobiles/           ships/             wear/

EXPLANATION:
   ... I just listed the contents of that file directory. Things in
       the list with a / after them are directories themselves. Other
       things are files that can be read or edited. <ls> was the command.

EXAMPLE:
When I type: more READ_ME

I see the following:

This is an example directory.
Files that are of typical Genesis origin, and are usable in the game
as examples for new wizards, may be put here. If the code is beeing
used or intended for use in the game, a note in the files should
clearly say so.

END

EXPLANATION:
   ... I just read a file called "READ_ME" using the <more> command.

EXAMPLE:
When I type: cd armours

I see the following:

CWD: /d/Genesis/doc/examples/armours

EXPLANATION:
   ... I just used <cd> again to go to a new directory called "armours".

EXAMPLE:
When I type: ls -lt

I see the following:

- magical_boots.c           9263  Jun  3 1998 20:55
- shield.c                   968  Apr 12 1997 05:08
- helmet.c                  1244  Apr 12 1997 05:08
* mail.c                    1182  Apr 12 1997 05:05

EXPLANATION:
   ... I now used <ls> with an extension of the command to get a list of
       things in the new directory with a bit more info.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2. Understanding the commands and what the above means:

        The above examples show the use of three commands:
            - cd, ls, more
        You should use the <help> command on each of these (e.g. <help cd>)
        to get info on what they do, and then practice navigating the file
        structures available to you now to see how they work. This will
        be important going forward. Feel free to explore further by getting
        <help> on commands you may notice in the SEE ALSO section of the
        help descriptions.
