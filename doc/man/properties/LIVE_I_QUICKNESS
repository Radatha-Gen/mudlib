Property   : LIVE_I_QUICKNESS

Description: Determines the delay between combat rounds. Positive values reduce
             the delay (and thus increase speed) and negative values increase
	     it (and thus slow the person down).

Formula    : Relative Delay = 250 - LIVE_I_QUICKNESS ; Speed = 1 / Rel.Delay

Range      : Maximum QUICKNESS = 150. No minimum.

Effect     : Due to the nature of the formula, the positive and negative scales
	     are not the same. You have to set to 125 to effectively double the
	     speed of the person, and to -250 to halve the speed.

	     QUICKNESS = -250    Rel.Delay = 500    Speed  -  50%
	     QUICKNESS =  100    Rel.Delay = 350    Speed  -  28%
	     QUICKNESS =    0    Rel.Delay = 250    Speed  default
	     QUICKNESS =   50    Rel.Delay = 200    Speed  +  25%
	     QUICKNESS =  100    Rel.Delay = 150    Speed  +  67%
	     QUICKNESS =  125    Rel.Delay = 125    Speed  + 100%
	     QUICKNESS =  150    Rel.Delay = 100    Speed  + 150%
