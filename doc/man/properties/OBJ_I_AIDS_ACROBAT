Property   : OBJ_I_AIDS_ACROBAT
Description: Determines the amount an item aids acrobatic dodging
             during combat. Currently only applicable to weapons.
Range      : -100 to +100
Effect     :
          Each use of the 2 tool slots penalizes the effectiveness
          of SS_ACROBAT by 50%. The default penalty due to
          weapon use can be overridden with this property.

          Non-knives by default have this value set to 0. Knives
          by default effectively have +100 OBJ_I_AIDS_ACROBAT and
          suffer no penalty. Setting this property on shields will
          have no effect. Setting the property on knives does
          not only overrides the default and does not add to the
          value.

          Under default settings:

          1 weapon + 1 shield -> 0%   SS_ACROBAT effectiveness
          2x weapons          -> 0%   SS_ACROBAT effectiveness
          1 weapon + 1 knife  -> 50%  SS_ACROBAT effectiveness
          1 knife + 1 shield  -> 50%  SS_ACROBAT effectiveness
          2x knives           -> 100% SS_ACROBAT effectiveness
          unarmed             -> 100% SS_ACROBAT effectiveness


          OBJ_I_AIDS_ACROBAT = -100     double weapon slot usage penalty
          OBJ_I_AIDS_ACROBAT =    0     standard weapon slot usage penalty
          OBJ_I_AIDS_ACROBAT = +100     no weapon slot usage penalty
