Property name: NPC_I_NO_FEAR_CHECK

When set in an NPC the fear check is disabled allowing all players to attack
it. Setting this should be an exception.

Note that when using this property, there must be a reasonable explanation
for using it from an atmospherical point of view, this to the discretion of
the AoB. This property may NEVER be set in mortal players!
