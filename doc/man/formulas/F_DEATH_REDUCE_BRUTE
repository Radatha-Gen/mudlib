Definition : F_DEATH_REDUCE_BRUTE(float brute)

Defined in : #include <formulas.h>

Description: When a player is recovering from a death, we can modify the
             brute factor. The brute factor is the fraction of the added
	     experience that is lost due to brutality. If you lower the
	     brute factor, the player keeps more of the added experience.

Arguments  : float brute - the brute factor.

Returns    : float - the modified (lowered!) brute factor.
