NAME
 	GMCP - Generic Mud Communication Protocol

DESCRIPTION
	The Generic Mud Communication Protocol (GMCP) is a standard method to
	pass easily parsable information to your mudclient. It's an extension
	to the normal telnet protocol, and sends messages invisible to the
	user (even when running a client that do not support GMCP). 

	The primary purpose of GMCP is to improve the availability of relevant
	information without providing players with a distinct advantage. As
	such, any information passed through the protocol will have the same
	detail as through the normal text interface.

	The Genesis client, Mudlet and CMud (version 3.22 and up) support the
	GMCP protocol. This includes the handling of the messages and a variety
	of the core features to interact with the game. It is up to the player
	to add triggers and or other scripts to use the provided information.
