NAME
        gifts - accept or reject gifts from a person

SYNOPSIS
	gifts [list]
	gifts accept <name>
	gifts reject <name>
	gifts remove <name>
	gifts today <name>

DESCRIPTION
	Normally people accept gifts from each other. To limit who can or
	cannot give you anything, the "giftfilter" option can be used. Note
	that this only works on interactive players. You always accept gifts
	from those who are in your team.

  off - Without giftfilter, you will accept gifts from anyone except those
	you explicitly "reject" gifts from. This is the default.

  on -	Giftfilter will reject gifts from anyone except those you explicitly
	"accept" gifts from. Use "today" to accept gifts from a person until
	you leave the realms.

OPTIONS
        [none] - show who you accept or reject gifts from.

	accept - Always accept gifts from <name>.
	today  - Accept gifts from <name> until you leave the realms.
		 These are only relevant if the giftfilter option is on.

	reject - Always reject gifts from <name>.
		 This is only relevant if the giftfilter option is off.

	remove - Remove <name> from your list of people you accept or reject
		 gifts from.
