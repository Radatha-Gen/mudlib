NAME
        block - attempt to prevent people from using a given exit

SYNOPSIS
        block <direction> (e.g. "north")

DESCRIPTION
        Players who have trained the block skill will become more able
        to prevent others from getting past them to leave a room. By
        choosing an obvious exit to block, the player attempts to
        stop anyone from using that exit. The higher the skill, the
        longer it will take people to get around them when using that
        exit.

        Players may only block a single exit at once. If a room has
        more than one exit, more than one player will be necessary
        to fully block all exits in a room.
        
        If you wish to stop blocking an exit, you can use <block stop>.
