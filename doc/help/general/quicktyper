NAME
	quicktyper - built in quicktyper functionality.

DESCRIPTION
	The quicktyper was designed to offer some functions that make life a
	little easier when typing commands. You can make aliases for long
	commands or commands you use often, you can easily repeat the last
	given command and you can execute a sequence of commands with only
	one command.

SYNOPSIS
	alias                  - show the list of current aliases
	alias cmd              - show the meaning of alias "cmd"
	alias cmd what to do   - make "cmd" an alias for "what to do"
	unalias cmd            - remove the alias named "cmd"
	do cmd1,cmd2,cmd3,..   - execute several commands in sequence
