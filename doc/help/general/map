NAME
	map - the magic map

DESCRIPTION
	The magic map displays a map of the area you are in. The map may also
	display in your client, if the functionality is supported. If the map
	is blank when you examine it this is because no one has yet taken the
	time to create a high-quality map of the loca area and integrated it
	into the game.

	If you feel skilled in creating maps out of text, please feel free to
	see what you can come up with. Create a text-based map of the area you
	are in. Then, send it to the wizards responsible for the area you are
	in, or to the aop team. Who knows, the map you create might become a
	permenant part of the game!
