NAME
	movement

SYNOPSYS
	<direction>
	go <direction>

DESCRIPTION
	The location you are in may display one or more obvious exits you can
	travel to, such as "north", or "up". To move in that direction, enter
	the word (e.g. "north", but "go north" also works). Even easier, the
	standard directions can be abbreviated, e.g. "n" for north, or "sw"
	for southwest.

	In addition, there may be less obvious exits from a location. If
	there is a tree, it may be possible to climb the tree, or if there
	is a portal, you could try to enter the portal.
