NAME
	herbs

SYNOPSIS
	This is not a command, simply information.

DESCRIPTION
        One of the most useful resources in the lands is the vast supply of
        herbs that can be found in most outdoor rooms that are not in cities
        or along major roads. The herbs may also be queried and traded at
        herbalist stores one may find.

        While most herbs are edible, some herbs require a different way of
        ingestion (such as e.g. chewing or smoking) in order to release their
        specific benefits.
