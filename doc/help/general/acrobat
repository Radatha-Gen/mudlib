NAME
	Acrobat

DESCRIPTION
	
	Acrobat skill can be utilized to avoid a hit like defense
	and parry skills. However, due to the nature of acrobatic
	manuevers, being encumbered will degrade your ability to
	avoid attacks acrobatically. Furthermore, wielding weapons
	other than knives and/or wearing shields will also hinder
	your ability to execute acrobatic moves.
