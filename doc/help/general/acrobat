NAME
	Acrobat

DESCRIPTION
	
	Acrobat skill can be utilized to avoid hits just like defense
	and parry skills. However, due to the nature of acrobatic
	manuevers, being encumbered will degrade your ability to
	avoid attacks acrobatically. Furthermore, wielding weapons
	other than knives or wearing shields will generally reduce 
	your ability to execute acrobatic moves. However, there are
	also some specific weapons in the realms that may hinder or
	aid your acrobatics beyond what is normal.
