NAME
        who - list people

SYNOPSIS
	who [fimwq]

DESCRIPTION
        Get a listing of the people logged on. Mortal players see all
        people they know. Wizards see all players. By default you will get
        a sorted list of the names of the players you know. An asterisk (*)
        is added to the names of those players that are not interactive.
        A name in brackets means the person is currently invisible, though
        you have powers to see the player anyway.

OPTIONS
        f - show the names and full titles of the people you know.
 
        i - do not show players that are not interactive (i.e. linkdead)
 
        m - show only the mortal players logged in.
 
        w - show only the wizards logged in.
	
	q - show all players in the queue. People whose name you do not
	    remember are shown as <unknown>. When used, it supercedes all
	    other options. For wizards, this option is void. (use finger)

NOTE
        The options 'w' and 'm' are obviously mutually exclusive. If you
        give them both, you will only get one (I think 'w').
