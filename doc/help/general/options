ARGUMENTS
	brief <on/off>       - With this option on, you only get a very short
			       description of locations you visit. Do not use
			       this option while exploring new areas, as you
                               will need all the information you can get there.

	echo <on/off>        - This option controls whether you see your
			       commands echoed on the screen or not.

        unarmed <on/off>     - When this is switched on, you will use unarmed
                               combat while you are wielding a weapon. When it
                               is switched off, then you will fully concentrate
                               on the weapon.

	gagmisses <on/off>   - When this is switched on, the game will not
			       show any misses you make in combat.

	merciful <on/off>    - When this is switched on, you will not kill an
			       opponent during combat, but you will stop just
			       before the victim would die. More information
			       can be found in "help mercy".
			       THIS OPTION IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET!

	wimpy <level>        - With this option you can become a wimp and wimpy
			       out of a fight if it does not go well for you.
			       You may find this option very useful and it is
                               especially recomended for beginners. However,
			       when running away from the fight, you will have
			       no time to decide where to run so you might end
			       up in the next room with a dozen more of those
			       horrible orcs.  Most times it will probably save
			       your life though.

		    For <level> you can substitute:

		    brave    - Never run, be brave!
	            <damage> - The health description of the unacceptable
			       damage level.
		    ?        - Give a list of available <damage> strings.

        see <on/off> or      - This options controls whether you see ongoing
	fights <on/off>        fights or not. This is particularly useful if
  			       you are running on a slow line and do not want
     			       to wait for all the scrolling of messages.

	autowrap <on/off>    - Indicate whether you want to automatically
			       wrap notes / mails with lines exceeding 80
			       characters per line.

	invenotry <on/off>   - Indicate whether you want to view your inventory
			       in a modern tabulated display, or not.

	morelen <len>        - The amount of lines "more" displays at a time,
                               in a range from 1 to 100. The default is 20.

	screenwidth <width>  - Your screen width, which may range from 40 to
                               200 columns. The default is 80.

                               side of the game.
