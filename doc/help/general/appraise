NAME
        appraise - estimate properties

SYNOPSIS
        appraise <object>
        appraise <money>
        appraise <living>
        appraise light

DESCRIPTION
        The appraise command allows you to quickly estimate the
        general properties of an object. Appraising money gives
        you an estimate of how much money there is in a pile.

OPTIONS
        <money>  - one of the standard money types
        <living> - a person or monster
        <object> - an object in your presence
        light    - judge the light in your surroundings.

ADDENDUM
        Weapons and armour save on a character for a certain
        period of time before breaking either from use or
        age. Appraise provides a time range for when it is
        likely these items will break in the form of:

           "Judging by its age and how much it appears to have 
            been used in combat you determine that it will last 
            a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 90 days before 
            it succumbs to wear and tear."

        The first time value is how much time in combat the item
        will last. The second time is the maximum 'shelf-life'
        of the weapon if it is no longer used.  Shelf-life 
        will scale downwards with time in combat.
