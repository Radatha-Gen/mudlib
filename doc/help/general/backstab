NAME
        backstab - backstab a living creature

SYNOPSIS
	backstab <target>
	backstab <target> with <dagger>

DESCRIPTION
        Those with skill in backstabbing may be able to position them-
        selves behind their opponent and stab them in the back with a
        knife or dagger. If hidden and the target is unsuspecting of
        an attack, the backstabber will have the advantage of surprise
        and do additional damage. 

        Backstab can also be used in a team when the backstabber is not
        the focus of an attacker, however the damage of such an attack
        is considerably less than a backstab with the element of 
        surprise.

        The chance of a successful surprise backstab is dependent on
        the backstabber's sneak skill and dexterity, while the target's
        awareness and intelligence also influences chance of success.

        Effectiveness of a backstab attack is dependent primarily on the
        backstab skill, the knife or dagger used, and the backstabber's 
        dexterity. It is also influenced to a lesser extent by the 
        backstabber's strength and intelligence.
