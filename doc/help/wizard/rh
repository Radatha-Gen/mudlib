NAME
	rh - report handler

SYNOPSIS
	rh
        rh L
	rh <owner>

DESCRIPTION
	The Report Handler gives access to the bug/idea/typo reports (replacing
        the single file logs). It works in a similar way as the mail reader.
        Each report has an owner based on the location of the code (a domain,
        wizard, or root for sys-reports) and a type (bug, idea or typo).

        Log handling is by subscription. By default wizards are subscribed to
        their own reports, and those of their domain. Within a log, it
        remembers the last report you read (like on boards)
        
ARGUMENTS
        <none>  - display the logs with new reports since last usage.
        ?       - display the built-in help on commands of the report handler.
        L       - display a summary of all logs you are subscribed on.
        <owner> - open the reports of a partcular owner.
