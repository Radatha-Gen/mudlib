DESCRIPTION
	This command helps with the management of maps and coordinate handling.

OPTIONS
        add    - Read the map file and stores the map(s) into the map central
	update	 register. Use this also to re-add/update after the map file
		 has been changed. This does NOT link the map to the rooms.
		 To link new rooms to the map use the 'map link' command.

        coords - Read the map file and displays the coordinates of all 'o' on
	         the map in x,y format. It is meant to help create the files
		 section (2nd block) of the map. When using this command, the
		 files section may be empty still.

        link   - Link the map to all files in a directory (that are referenced
		 in the map) after the map was added or updated. You need to be
                 in one of the rooms that's on the map for this to work.
		 If a map may contain links to files in multiple directories,
		 repeat as often as needed from different rooms.

        list   - Display the rooms from this the map <file> is linked.
		 Alternatively, displays the maps that are linked to the files
		 in the directory associated to the room you are in.

        remove - Remove the map file and all room references to it from the
		 central register.

	test   - Read the map file and displays all maps therein. X marks the
	         spot for all coordinates in the files section (2nd block) of
		 the map.	         

	<file> - the full path to the map file /d/Domain/open/MAP_FILES/xxx.txt
