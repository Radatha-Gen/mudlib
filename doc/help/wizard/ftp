NAME
	ftp

DESCRIPTION
	Ftp is a standard program for transfering of files between
	network connected machines. You use a client on your machine
	to connect to a server on this machine. Clients are available
	on most machine types, even MacIntoshes, PCs, Amigas and IBM
	mainframes.

USAGE
	You begin an ftp session by starting your client. The address
	is the same as the address you use to connect to the mud. Note
	to use port 1821 for ftp in to Genesis.

		Example: ftp genesis.cs.chalmers.se 1821
		Example: ftp 129.16.225.60 1821

	When prompted for name you type '<wizname>'.

		Example: commander

	When prompted for password you type your LPMud password.

	You are now logged in and you can access all files in the directory
	you start in, and all directories below it. If you are a
	Wizard you start in your home directory. If you are a Lord,
	an Archwizard or a Keeper you start in the home directory
	of your domain.

		Example: Lord Styles: /d/Liwitch
		Example: Wizard Hebol: /d/Liwitch/hebol

	Ftp clients for different machines are not identical, so it's hard 
	to describe exactly how to transfer files. Some commands that almost 
	always work are:

	- get: get a file from the remote machine
	- put: send a filie to the remote machine
	- ls:  list the directory contents on the remote machine
	- dir: same as ls
	- cd:  change directory on the remote machine
	- bye: end the session
	- quit: end the session
