NAME
	shutdown - shut the game down

SYNOPSIS
	shutdown <delay> <reason>
	shutdown now <reason>
	shutdown abort
        shutdown runlevel <type>
        shutdown runlevel all
        shutdown schedule <date>

DESCRIPTION
	With this command you tell the gamedriver to shut down. Your name and
	the stated reason for shutdown are logged. This command should only be
	used in emergencies. It is best to use a delay, usually ten minutes, to
	allow mortal players to sell stuff and get back to their home location.

	When the memory is almost used up, (that is: the memory usage is 97% or
	greater), you can ask Armageddon to shut down the game due to lack of
	memory by typing 'shutdown 10 memory_failure'. Memory is not triggered,
	but tested in an interval so the memory can well exceed the 100% before
	Army notices. Administrators may invoke a 'regular_reboot' as reason. A
	shutdown may also be scheduled for a specific date/time.

	Misuse = demotion.

        Using the 'runlevel' subcommand, archwizards and keepers may close
        the game to particular groups of people. Use 'runlevel apprentice'
        to close the game to all mortals, but allow all wizard types to
        enter. Using 'runlevel arch' will allow only arches and keepers in.

OPTIONS
	<delay>  - the delay in minutes before the game is acutally
		   shut down.
	now	 - shut the game down without delay.
	<reason> - the reason why you shut the game down. This reason is
		   displayed to the mortals when they are notified.
	abort	 - abort a previously started shutdown sequence. If the
		   game is being shut down due to memory failure, it is
		   not possible to abort the sequence.
	<date>   - to schedule a shutdown (at least 1 day in the future)
		   specify a date/time stamp: mmm dd yyyy hh:mm[:ss]

        all      - open the game for all mortals and wizards.
        <type>   - restrict the game to wizards of the rank <type> and
                   higher.
