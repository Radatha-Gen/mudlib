NAME
	unmetflag - Set the flag so you do not know everyone

SYNOPSIS
	unmetflag
	unmetflag npc

DESCRIPTION
	Wizards normally know everybody. With this command, you can set not
	to know everybody, meaning you always get their unmet description.
	When you do "unmetflag npc" you will know all players, but for NPC's
	you get their unmet description, even if they introduced themselves.

	The LIVE_I_ALWAYS_KNOWN property always overrules any unmet setting.
