This file contains the logfile of changes made to the CD mudlib, starting
from version CD.00.10:

Some of the changes before CD.00.10.

CD.00.01 - CD.00.090

The directory structure was redesigned, see DIR_DOCS

The inheritance structure and the standard files were redesigned, see
/doc/general

The Genesis specific things were separated into the domain /d/Genesis making
export of the mudlib more simple.

A geography was introduced and the 'empty' world now consist of only the map
and one startroom.

A number of concepts were introduced or changed, examples are teams, 'unmet',
experience, stats, skills


CD.00.10 (910630-)

JnA:	All the races moved to /d/Genesis/race, they are considered part of
	Genesis, one default race left in /std/human_std

JnA:	All rooms in /room except void.c and start.c deleted.

JnA:	/secure/config.h created for global mud configuration

JnA:	long() is remade to return strings instead of writing them.

JnA:	/doc/general/meet_people created, documents the 'met' principles

JnA:	/doc/general/boot_world created, documents how preloading works

JnA:	New preload system created in /secure/master.c using epilog()

JnA:	The terrain library for the map moved to /d/Genesis/terrain, these are
	also considered unique to Genesis and not standard mudlib.

JnA:	The 'coordinate' maprooms are now created in /d/Standard

JnA:	/room and /obj deleted, files are now in /d/Genesis/room & obj

JnA:	Textfiles printed at login are now under /d/Genesis/login the login
	text files under /doc/login rewritten to fit standard mud. The names
	of the login files are defined in /secure/config.h

JnA:	/doc/general/experience created, documenting the new exp system

JnA:	Created hooks for spells in /std/player/cmdhooks_sec.c Spells are now
	freely defined by calling these funcs in the player:
	  player->add_spell(verb, func, obj) samt
	  player->remove_spell(verb)

JnA:	All heart_beat related routines for living objects now in 
	/std/living/heart_beat.c General routines for adding 'heart_beat
	functions' to living objects created. add_heart_beat(func, obj) is now
	used in /std/living/combat.c and /std/living/stats.c for attack() and
	decr_tmp_stats() 

JnA:	/obj/monster and combat routines now work, barely, there is a test-
	monster in /w/commander/orc.c


CD.00.11 (910718-)

JnA:	OPEN_DOMAINS created in /secure/config.h for domains that should
	be public read.

JnA:	A reference manual of some of the standard objects are now reachable
	through the 'man' command. A special flag '-s' gives a directed
	'more' in the right spot of the source code.

JnA:	/secure/admin subdir renamed to /secure/master

JnA:	KEEPERSAVE.o moved from /secure to /syslog reflecting the need to
	separate sourcecode and data in different subdirs.

JnA:	Arch and keepers can now read and write the files /syslog/WIZARD
	and /syslog/DOMAINS These are files holding all information on
	wizards and domains in the game. Commands for this are wizreg/domreg

JnA:	/global/std/link_commands remade to use only one array in the
	its masterobject to hold the command and function names.

JnA:	/global/std/link_commands and all its derivatives now use clean_up()

JnA:	Error log files now logs errors in /log/name


CD.00.12 (910818-)

JnA:   The 'bug' and 'typo' command fixed.

JnA:	Movement in the map fixed

JnA:	Local 'errorlog' moved to the files /w/wizname/errors 
	/d/domainname/common/errors /d/domainname/wiz/errors
	Not everyone had the right to remove files from /log and everyone must
	be able to edit and remove their errorlogs

JnA:	The config file moved to /config.h and /secure/config.h made into the
	standard file for exporting.

JnA:	/secure/login.c fixed to handle reset_object() correctly

JnA:	The 'adjdesc' command created to allow players to add adjectives to
	thier 'nonmet_name'. The adjectives are stored in the save file.

JnA:	The 'metname' of players are title + name

JnA:   	Keeper commands for managing questflags fixed. Kepper can manage and
	everybody can check questflags through 'qflag' command.

JnA:   	The 'help' command fixed so that it returns '0' if it fails to find
	an appropriate help file.

JnA:	/std/coins moved to /d/Genesis/obj

JnA:	Wizcommands now properly handles '~'

JnA:	clean_up() introduced in /std/room.c

JnA:	Arch + Keeper can now force wizards

JnA:	Some security leaks in valid_ in /secure/master fixed. These were
	related to '.' '..' and '//', thanks to Dworkin for detection.

CD.00.13 (910823-)

JnA:	Modifications to player long() and query_presentation() so that
	long includes the nonmet_name and presentation includes gender. Also
	the 'introduce' command now gives the whole presentation line.

JnA:	Fixed a bug in /std/object::move() that made moving from nothingness,
	ie when things are created, cause an error. This bug had bad effects
	on autoloading, which now should work.

JnA:	remove_name() and remove_pname() added to /std/object

JnA:	Preloading should now work, using the file preload.c, 
	see /doc/general/boot_world

JnA:	List of starting locations now available for wizards,
	start command fixed in "/global/wiz_cmd_apprentice" and
	two functions added in /secure/master

JnA:	adj + first name is now default in short() in /std/object
	if no set_short() is made.

JnA:	The trace() and traceprefix() efuns are now validated through
	/secure/master.c The function valid_trace(obj, set_value) in master
	checks if an object has the right to set a certain value.

JnA:	Finger is added as a command for all wizards. It gives info on players
	logged in or not. There is two functions in /secure/master for this:
	exist_player(name) and finger_player(name). See docs in /secure/master

JnA:	Fixed all sorts of things with teams, new command 'team'

JnA:	Lots of fixes on 'the' as article in many places.


CD.00.14 (910831-)

RW:	Almost done with the spell system. Made a total revision of the wizard
	souls. Wizard souls are now loaded separately and not inherited into
	each other. The localcmd command (efun) has now the same name in the
	game as well, not "basecmd" as before. The command to get a list of
	all commands is now "allcmd". The allcmd routine is moved from 
	/global/wiz_cmd_apprentice.c to /std/player_sec.c in order to be 
	callable in other players as well.

JnA:	A new system for calling constructors and reset. When the object is
	loaded, create_something() is called and when the object is reset,
	reset_something() is called. This replaces the argument to reset().
	Both create_ and reset_ is called without argument.

JnA:	There is a command 'errlog' to display errlog files. Both errlog
	and review now take a name as an optional parameter.

JnA:	The finger information has been rewritten with the help of Mort,
	necessary functions have been added to player. These include
	login_time, login_from and a functional aging. There is also special
	functions in the player to hook specific objects that wants to give
	extra finger information, this can be used for the post.

JnA:	A slight bug in move has been fixed to show correct msg on teleport.

JnA:	Object dropping on quit now checks for OBJ_NO_DROP.

JnA:	Changed the path resolver in /sys/global/filepath, it now uses a
	revised Dworkin version. Also fixed 'cd' so it gives proper errors
	on nonexisting dirs.

JnA:	Revised the /doc/general/INTRO to be correct, mostly new reset/create

RW:	Finished with the spell stuff. New command "spells" in misc_soul that
	lists all active spells of a player, and new command "all_spells" in
	wiz_cmd_arch that lists all spells that has been activated in the 
	game during one session.

RW:	Added trust/distrust of objects. Rewritten set_trusted in /std/object.

JnA:	Reshuffled stuff from /std/player/ to /std/living/. Cleaned up in
	/std/npc. Moved: /std/living/cmdhooks.c /std/living/ucombat.c
	/std/living/spells.c New: /std/player/pcombat.c
	This was mainly because stuff that both player and NPC uses should
	be in living not included separately in player and npc.

JnA:	Fixed new /std/living/drink_eat.c handling all forms of drink and
	food for living objects. Made /std/food.c and /std/drink.c
	The latter also gives good examples of how to use command parsing.

JnA:	Fixed local logs of bugs, typos and ideas in the files:
	~/bugs ~/typos ~/ideas
	Commands for reading logs: buglog, typolog and idealog

JnA:	Fixed so 'adjdesc' now deletes old adjectives. 

RW:	Added limit of two adjectives, < 35 chars to set_adj()

RW:	Added get_wizlist(), get_domainlist() to manage_wizard. Have started
	adding of user friendly funktions in the souls to use these new
	funktions.

JnA:	Added lots of docfiles under /doc/lfun, many are still just there
	for index purposes but it is now possible to get an overview of 
	the functions in some of the /std files.

JnA:	Fixed some bugs in the teams routines, following leaders and some
	limits on invite also a list of invited is now given.

JnA:	Made some changes to move() in /std/object it checks for OBJ_NO_GIVE
	and it might be slightly more effective.

CD.00.15 (910903-)

RW:	Fixed finger so that it displays information about domain affiliation
	and other relevant information. Finger also works on domains now
	giving information about the members.

RW:	Added some functions to manage_wizard.c to access the a_wizards array.

RW:	Added gameinfo feature. (log in as "gameinfo")

RW:	Changed KEEPERSAVE so that it uses unique numbers to identify
	wizards.

RW:	Added idle time to finger.

CD.00.16 (910918-)

JH:	Modified the mudlib to run GD v 45

JH:	Fixed a bug in movement of the player to selected login point.

JH:	Modified the restart script. The following changes are implemented:
	- The log files are named lplog<number> instead of lpmud.log<number>
	- The present log file has a link to the file 'lplog'
	- The latest of the previous logfiles has a link to the file
	  'lplogprev'
	- All the lplog<number> files are deleted when the script is
	  restarted

JH:	Wrote the log-error function in master.c.

JH:	The uid/euid of a non-wizard player is now 'backbone'.

JH:	Changed autoload to use array instead of compound string. Each
	array element is still in the form <object path>:<args>. Nothing
	outside the player objects should be affected.
	This also fixes the auto-load security hole.

JnA:	All logfiles now placed in ~/log/ 
	This includes the efun: log_file()

JnA:    /std/workroom.c created. wiz_home() in master.c creates a workroom
	if noone exists. The standard workroom includes a bulletin board.

JnA:    Value by function call now uses '@@' instead of '*'

JnA:	/w eliminated all lonely wizards now under /d/Wiz
	This special domain is defined in /local.h as WIZARD_DOMAIN

JH:	Fully typed living, container and object

JnA:    Total rework of the domain application and promotin demoting system.

CD.00.17 (911003-)

JH:	Fully typed player, corpse and armour.

JH:	Added inheritable scroll to /std

Jh:	Changed syntax of set_learn_pref, it now takes the entire array
	of learn_prefs as argument and recalculetes the values so the sum
        always is 100

RW:	Rewritten the domain application system. Patched heavily in 
	manage_domain, _wizard in general.

RW:	Interface to commandsouls rewritten as well as rehacked the way
	they are loaded.

RW:	Fully typed all wizard souls, rewritten the tracer to become a
	tool soul.

CD.00.18 (911012-)

JH:	Fully typed room, heap, food and drink.

JH:	Masked add_verb and add_xverb, they will now generate errors when used

RW:	Reworked the spell handling system. Written a man page about it.

RW:	Redone people. Lots of laughs.

RW:	Fixed domain bits. There still remains to mask set_bit etc if
	that's a good idea. Maybe the best idea is to keep it as a quick
	& compact way of storing info internally in objects.

RW:	Redone most of the properties. Renamed them all.

RW:	Logs in promote/demote & add/remove domain.

RW:	Old unused wizard numbers are now reused.

RW:	It's now possible to log in help characters as "xxxjr"

RW:	Objects now have a set_no_show and query_no_show function.
	Objects with no_show = 1 can't be seen or touched.

RW:	When a property is changed, the function notify_change_prop
	is called in the environment object.

RW:	Written /std/door.c and /std/key.c . NOT funny.

JH:	Working death installed.

JnA:	Coins are now autoloading

JnA:	Written basic functionality for 'intelligent' NPC's

CD.00.19 (911111-)

JnA:	move() now considers things living ONLY if they inherit from
	"/std/living". This allows rooms to enable commands to get
	calls to catch_tell().

JnA:	Made some example implementation of seqactions and trigactions
	in /std/monster allowing random walk and chat among other things.

JnA:	'possess monster' fixed in wiz_cmd_apprentice. It is now possible to
	'listen in' and control one or more NPC's.

JnA:  	'/std/srcbook' created for automatic extraction of comments and
	also for searching and reading in extracted doc.

JnA:    Coins are destructed when players are saved.

JnA:	Fixed: @ Zhaumer: Could you please make it possible for the domain
	                   Lord tpo remove notes from his OWXN board ??

JnA:  	The number of skills are now unlimited and implemented as two
	arrays in living.

JnA:	destruct -D forces immidiate destruct with destruct(ob) instead of
	ob->remove_object()

JnA:    Shadow security, LPC version fixed for new master.c scheme using
	query_allow_shadow.

JnA:    Externalized the combat code into /std/xcombat.c also added a #define
	in /local.h, The combat system can now be defined under /d/Genesis

JnA:    Moved alot from /std/simul_efun to /secure/compat_efun, there are
	some trouble with shells. master.c does NOT use compat_efun

CD.00.20 (911201-)

JnA:    The basic functionality for guilds implemented with autoloading
	shadows.

JnA:    Deathsequence debugged. Corpses now emulate met routines better.

JnA:    'put in container' debugged. Commands metflag/unmetflag added.

JnA: 	The map debugged for 9x9 km subsquares and negative coordinates

JnA:	Light now changes when the light property changes. This is now
	true for all forms of containers, recursively.

JnA:	Audience now only works for wizards. Mortals have a 'commune' 
	command which is a global shout to all wizards logged in. This
	is 'in extreme emergency only'. If misused the mortal can be abused.

JnA:    Lots of bugfixes in drink_eat, xcombat, descriptions and some 
	rehacking of the door. Lots of help from Nick.

JnA:    A new generic combat system implemented using attacks and
	hitlocations. Weapons and armour are backwards compatible.

CD.00.21 (911224-)

JnA:   	Things depending on DIS implemented. Panic and selfdiscipline in
	combat, together with leadership capability in teams.

JnA:    The 'possess' command is replaced with 'control' as that is actually
	what happens. Also present monsters can be controlled without having
	declared a 'set_living_name()'.

JnA:    Added ROOM_I_NO_CLEANUP property.

RW:	Added possess function.

RW:	Added enter quota to login.c

CD.00.22 (920107-)

RW&JnA: The gamedriver is all changed and the mudlib code modified to fit.

JnA:	Some severe bugs with /secure/simul_efun fixed

JnA:	VBFC in all set_ functions can now handle stringvalues on the form
	"text @@VBFC@@ more text"

JbH /	A new login system for mortals and a new system for reincarnation
JnA 	implemented.

JnA	Ironside wanted to give positive comments. So, now there is a
	'praise' command to complement bug, typo and idea.
	Wizards have a 'praiselog' command that works like 'buglog' etc.

JnA	/std/object now handles names and other lists with mappings, new
	functions query_props(), query_names(), query_pnames(), query_adjs()

JnA:	Some smallish bugs fixed:
		remember lists (capitalize and some errors)
		kill parsing (victim must can be specified better)
	        Autosave 
		Armageddon

JnA:	Modified wcpen / skill so that skill is included in the attack. It will
	default to wcpen if not given. The actual penetration is calculated
	at penetration time. Formula is given in /sys/formulas.h F_PENMOD

NH:     Hunting now works though I'm sure it can be improved. When you enter
        a room you will attack everybody you regard as an enemy and the rest
        of the objects to see if they think upon you as an enemy, and if so
        they attack.

NH:     The quest bits are no longer erased when a player dies.

JnA:	Names, pnames and adjectives are now implemented with arrays again.
	
CD.00.23 (920225- )

Patrick Atoon (Tricky@Genesis)

	- Lots of comments (... LOTS ...) added all through the mudlib.

Michael (aka Data@PaderMud):

	- /cmd/std/quicktyper.c: fixed deletion of aliases.

	- /cmd/wiz_cmd_arch.c: added show_default (a save in
	allow_default is still missing!)

	- /cmd/wiz_cmd_normal.c: removed the necessity to be in the
	ADMIN_HOME for banishing. And fixed the shutdown, so it logs now the
	reason correctly.

	- /lib/guild_support.c: the calculations there were wrong.

	- /d/Standard/login/ghost_player.c, /secure/login.c,
	/secure/master.c, /secure/oldplayer.c (Login Code): As long as there
	exists the file defined by LOGIN_NO_NEW, only wizards from /op (and
	their helpers) are allowed to enter the game. The old player files in
	/op can be of the form n/name.o as well as simply name.o.

	- /secure/master/fob.c: Minor bug, when no applications have
	been made ever.

	- /std/board/bb_gedit.c, /std/board/board_more.c,
	/std/board/msg_input.c, /std/board.c: Various small bugs in the board
	handling.

	- /std/weapon.c: We could not find W_KNIFE in the
	distribution.

	- /sys/macros.h: #include "/local.h" to make the metsystem
	work correctly.

	- /std/combat/cbase.c: fixed minor typo

	- /std/container::create_container(): containers could not be
	cloned and configured, because /std/object::create_object was called.
	This deleted the VBFCs for weight & volume.

	- /std/living/drink_eat.c: fixed heartbeat. the programmer
	misinterpreted the shortcut or operator ||, so stuffed, soaked &
	headache were set to 0, if intox != 0.

	- /std/drink.c & /std/food.c could be consumed multiple
	times!!!  The old code is very tricky and tries to remember was
	consumed in the short description (it is set to 0), but /std/object.c
	is even more tricky, it simple gives the short a new value (that is
	also returned by query_short()).  Even a change to
	call_out("remove_object",0) doesn't help!  Bugfix: All names are
	deleted. So /std/object.c can't create a new short(). (Not a beautiful
	patch, but the simplest, I think: just one line.)

	- /std/scroll.c: added a #include "/local.h"

	- /std/weapon.c: Minor bug: M_KNIFE is not present in the
	standard distribution.

	- /sys/global/money::split_values was incredibly inefficient,
	although the same file contained the div/mod-version for splitting.
	The old version COUNTED COINS.

	- /sys/macros.h: should include "/local.h" to make the
	metsystem work.
