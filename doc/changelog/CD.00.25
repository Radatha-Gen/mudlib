/sys/map.h /secure/master/manage_maplinks.c 
/std/room/map.c /std/map/map.c /std/mapsquare.c
	The map system reworked and many defines changed.

	map.h changed so that it tries to include /config/sys/map_defines.h and
	if it fails sets all necessary defines to default values.

/secure/master.c
	Handwritten VBFC's are filtered out in modify_command(). 

	The do_debug() does not allow anyone to execute any subcommand,
	some are restricted to euid == 'root'. Typical example: 'shutdown'

/std/object.c
	Fixed the very elusive money pickup bug.

/cmd/std/misc/manipulate.c
	Improved error message code.
	
/cmd/std/misc/manipulate.c
	Removed the introduced errors in the error message code

/secure/master.c
	A regular 'check_memory' function that is called to check
	so that memory does not run out but if so start Armageddon.

/std/living/cmdhooks.c
	In my_commands() tool_souls and soul_souls are also loaded with
	a 'catch' to prevent terminating errors when a soul is bad.

/secure/std.h 
	The WIZ_CHECK macro is changed to see that this_interactive() 
	actually returns an object.

/cmd/wiz_cmd_normal.c
	Fixed so that /secure/master can be safely updated with the
	'update' command.

/std/map/manager.c
	A standard file for allowing domains to be linked to the map in
	a simple way.

/std/player_sec.c /secure/login.c /cmd/wiz_cmd_apprentice
	Possibility to query a relay of the real host from which a user
	connects to the relay.

/cmd/std/misc_cmd.c /sys/stdproperties.h /cmd/std/soul_cmd.c
	Fixed with a temporary property so that 'non things' in sublocations
	is not seen in 'inventory'.

/secure/armageddon.c
	Can be told to send players home to where they start. Note that
	you need to give mortal a tell command for this to work.

/secure/master.c
	Rewritten valid_snoop(). Hopefully it's both easier to read and
	less infested with bugs now.

/secure/master.c
/secure/master/fob.c
/local.h
	Rewritten the part that autoloads a set of domains and wizards in
	the case that the KEEPERSAVE file is missing. The game should now
	be distributd _without_ a keepersave file.

/std/mapsquare.c
/std/mapsquare/paths.c
/std/mapsquare/roads.c
/std/mapsquare/rivers.c
	Added functionality for roads and rivers in maprooms.

/secure/master.c /local.h
	Added handling of UDP messages and UDP_MANAGER in /local.h
	
/std/living/savevars.c
	Changed add_exp so that it does what it was supposed to do, namely
	never take away normal xp only combat xp.

/secure/master /secure/master/fob.c
	Code for keeping track of exp given to mortals on domain basis.
	bookkeep_exp and decay_exp in fob.c and a regular call in
	check_memory()

/secure/master.c
/secure/simul_efun.c
/cmd/wiz_cmd_arch.c
/cmd/wiz_cmd_normal.c
/cmd/wiz_cmd_apprentice.c
	Removed the following simul_efuns and updated files accordingly:
	rusage, top_ten_cpu, object_cpu, swap, version, wizlist, trace, 
	traceprefix, call_out_info, inherit_list, query_load_average shutdown.


Reorganization of files as follows:
        /config renamed to /config.std to prevent overwriting it when unpacking
        new distribution.

        /local.h moved to /config/sys/local.h 

Added day/night and time system from PaderMud.

Added code that takes care of linkdead players. Also from Pader.


Patch CD.00.25.1

/sys/global/udp.c
	Fixed a lot of things in the udp code and added a shutdown command
	to the protocol.

/cmd/wiz_cmd_apprentice.c /secure/master/fob.c
	Added a domain ranking list.
	
/cmd/wiz_cmd_apprentice.c
	Rewrote the 'gd' command to take 'tracer-like' object parameters.

/std/know_me /cmd/std/misc/met.c
	Lars wanted everyone to see him on the who list, therefore this
	little object. If held by a wizard it makes that wizard known
	to all other players in the game.

/std/object.c
	nomask deleted on query_prop() Is that really a security risk?
